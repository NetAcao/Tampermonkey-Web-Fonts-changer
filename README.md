# Websites Font Changer to Montserrat
As I browsed the web, I found myself struggling to read the content on many websites. The font choices, while visually appealing, were not optimised for my needs. 

Researchers found that changing the font to one better suited to an individual resulted in a 35% increase in reading speed while maintaining comprehension. I created Font Customizer – a script that allows users to seamlessly replace website fonts with their preferred, more accessible options.  By default, I will use the Montserrat font, but more options will be added over time. While I initially developed this tool for my own use, I quickly realised the potential it holds for a wide range of readers.

It's important to note that Font Customizer is not a one-size-fits-all solution. While the script is designed to respect the integrity of specialised fonts, such as those used for math equations or icons, ensuring they are not overridden and continue to display properly, it is not error-free. I will be constantly monitoring for any bugs or errors that may arise, and I encourage users to let me know if encounter any issues. Thank you
